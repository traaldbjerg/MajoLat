            We address the problem of finding the optimal common resource for an arbitrary family of target states in quantum resource theories based on majorization, that is, theories whose conversion law between resources is determined by a majorization relationship, such as it happens with entanglement, coherence or purity. We provide a conclusive answer to this problem by appealing to the completeness property of the majorization lattice. We give a proof of this property that relies heavily on the more geometric construction provided by the Lorenz curves, which allows to explicitly obtain the corresponding infimum and supremum. Our framework includes the case of possibly non-denumerable sets of target states (i.e. targets sets described by continuous parameters). In addition, we show that a notion of approximate majorization, which has recently found application in quantum thermodynamics, is in close relation with the completeness of this lattice. Finally, we provide some examples of optimal common resources within the resource theory of quantum coherence.},

It is shown that more than one measure is required simultaneously in order to quantify completely the non-local resources contained in a bipartite pure state, while examining how this fact does not hold in the so-called asymptotic limit.

The main emphasis of these investigations is on the deterministic, or probabilistic transformations between two states and mainly tools from linear algebra are employed. Here, we go one step beyond that and analyze all optimal protocols. We show that for all bipartite and almost all multipartite (of arbitrarily many d-level systems) pairs of states, there exist infinitely many optimal intermediate states to which the initial state can first be transformed (locally) before it is transformed to the final state. The success probability of this transformation is nevertheless optimal. We provide a simple characterization of all intermediate states. We generalize this concept to differentiable paths in Hilbert space that connect two states of interest. With the help of survival analysis we determine the success probability for the continuous transformation along such a path and derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the optimality. We show, in strong contrast to previous results on state transformations, that optimal paths are characterized as solutions of a differential equation. Whereas, for almost all pairs of states, there exist infinitely many optimal paths, we present examples of pairs of states for which not even a single optimal intermediate state exists. Furthermore, we introduce a physically motivated distance measure, the interconversion metric, and show that (generically) any minimal geodesic with respect to the interconversion metric is an optimal path. Moreover, we identify infinitely many easily computable entanglement monotones for generic multipartite pure states. We show that a given finite set of these entanglement monotones can be used to completely characterize the entanglement contained in a generic state.},

We note that in the infinite-temperature limit, the thermodynamic ordering of states in both regimes exhibits a lattice structure. This means that when energy does not matter and the only thermodynamic resource is given by information, the thermodynamic arrow of time has a very specific structure. Namely, for any two states at present there exists a unique state in the past consistent with them and with all possible joint pasts. Similarly, there also exists a unique state in the future consistent with those states and with all possible joint futures. We also show that the lattice structure in the classical regime is broken at finite temperatures, i.e., when energy is a relevant thermodynamic resource. Surprisingly, however, we prove that in the simplest quantum scenario of a two-dimensional system, this structure is preserved at finite temperatures. We provide the physical interpretation of these results by introducing and analyzing the history erasure process, and point out that quantum coherence may be a necessary resource for the existence of an optimal erasure process.},

The Schmidt vector of a bipartite mixed state is defined using two distinct methods: as a concave roof extension of Schmidt vectors of pure states, or equivalently, from the set of pure states that can be transformed into the mixed state through local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We demonstrate that the Schmidt vector fully characterizes separable and maximally entangled states. Furthermore, we prove that the Schmidt vector is monotonic and strongly monotonic under LOCC, giving necessary conditions for conversions between mixed states. Additionally, we extend the definition of the Schmidt rank from pure states to mixed states as the cardinality of the support of the Schmidt vector and show that it is equal to the Schmidt number introduced in previous work [Phys. Rev. A 61, 040301 (R), 2000]. Finally, we introduce a family of entanglement monotones by considering concave and symmetric functions applied to the Schmidt vector.},

	abstract = {We study entropy inequalities for variables that are related by functional dependencies. Although the powerset on four variables is the smallest Boolean lattice with non-Shannon inequalities, there exist lattices with many more variables where the Shannon inequalities are sufficient. We search for conditions that exclude the existence of non-Shannon inequalities. The existence of non-Shannon inequalities is related to the question of whether a lattice is isomorphic to a lattice of subgroups of a group. In order to formulate and prove the results, one has to bridge lattice theory, group theory, the theory of functional dependences and the theory of conditional independence. It is demonstrated that the Shannon inequalities are sufficient for planar modular lattices. The proof applies a gluing technique that uses that if the Shannon inequalities are sufficient for the pieces, then they are also sufficient for the whole lattice. It is conjectured that the Shannon inequalities are sufficient if and only if the lattice does not contain a special lattice as a sub-semilattice.},

The incomparability graph of L, denoted by Γ′(L), is a graph with vertex set W(L) and two distinct vertices a, b ∈ W(L) are adjacent if and only if they are incomparable. In this paper, we study the incomparability graphs of lattices. We prove that, a disconnected graph is a graph of a lattice L if and only if L is of the form \$L\_\{1\}{\textbackslash}bigoplus L\_\{2\}\$. We prove that, Γ′(L) cannot be an n-gon for any n ≥ 5.

	abstract = {The second law of thermodynamics imposes a fundamental asymmetry in the flow of events. The so-called thermodynamic arrow of time introduces an ordering that divides the system's state space into past, future, and incomparable regions. In this work, we analyze the structure of the resulting thermal cones, i.e., sets of states that a given state can thermodynamically evolve to (the future thermal cone) or evolve from (the past thermal cone). Specifically, for a 𝑑-dimensional classical state of a system interacting with a heat bath, we find explicit construction of the past thermal cone and the incomparable region. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of their behavior based on thermodynamic monotones given by the volumes of thermal cones. Results obtained apply also to other majorization-based resource theories (such as that of entanglement and coherence), since the partial ordering describing allowed state transformations is then the opposite of the thermodynamic order in the infinite temperature limit. Finally, we also generalize the construction of thermal cones to account for probabilistic transformations.},
