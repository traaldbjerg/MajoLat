A mathematical characterization of these monotone magnitudes is presented. They are then related to optimal strategies of conversion of shared states. More detailed results are presented for pure states of bipartite systems. It is shown that more than one measure is required simultaneously in order to quantify completely the non-local resources contained in a bipartite pure state, while examining how this fact does not hold in the so-called asymptotic limit. Finally, monotonicity under local transformations is proposed as the only natural requirement for measures of entanglement.},

In this work, we analyze the structure of the resulting thermal cones, i.e., sets of states that a given state can thermodynamically evolve to (the future thermal cone) or evolve from (the past thermal cone). Specifically, for a ùëë-dimensional classical state of a system interacting with a heat bath, we find explicit construction of the past thermal cone and the incomparable region. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of their behavior based on thermodynamic monotones given by the volumes of thermal cones. Results obtained apply also to other majorization-based resource theories (such as that of entanglement and coherence), since the partial ordering describing allowed state transformations is then the opposite of the thermodynamic order in the infinite temperature limit. Finally, we also generalize the construction of thermal cones to account for probabilistic transformations.},

For K = N the induced measure is equal to the Hilbert-Schmidt measure, which is shown to coincide with the measure induced by singular values of non-Hermitian random Gaussian matrices pertaining to the Ginibre ensemble.

This review both introduces some elements of majorization theory and describes recent results on bipartite entanglement transformations, with special emphasis being placed on explaining the connections between these two topics.

We note that in the infinite-temperature limit, the thermodynamic ordering of states in both regimes exhibits a lattice structure. This means that when energy does not matter and the only thermodynamic resource is given by information, the thermodynamic arrow of time has a very specific structure. Namely, for any two states at present there exists a unique state in the past consistent with them and with all possible joint pasts. Similarly, there also exists a unique state in the future consistent with those states and with all possible joint futures. We also show that the lattice structure in the classical regime is broken at finite temperatures, i.e., when energy is a relevant thermodynamic resource. Surprisingly, however, we prove that in the simplest quantum scenario of a two-dimensional system, this structure is preserved at finite temperatures. We provide the physical interpretation of these results by introducing and analyzing the history erasure process, and point out that quantum coherence may be a necessary resource for the existence of an optimal erasure process.},

It is not necessarily tight when the marginal distribution of X is fixed. This paper gives a tight upper bound on the conditional entropy of X given Y in terms of the error probability and the marginal distribution of X. A new lower bound on the conditional entropy for countably infinite alphabets is also found. The relationship between the reliability criteria of vanishing error probability and vanishing conditional entropy is also discussed. A strengthened form of the Schur-concavity of entropy which holds for finite or countably infinite random variables is given.},

  abstract = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

While LOCC emerges as the natural class of operations in many important quantum information tasks, its mathematical structure is complex and difficult to characterize. Here we provide a precise description of LOCC and related operational classes in terms of quantum instruments. Our formalism captures both finite round protocols as well as those that utilize an unbounded number of communication rounds. While the set of LOCC is not topologically closed, we show that finite round LOCC constitutes a compact subset of quantum operations. Additionally we show the existence of an open ball around the completely depolarizing map that consists entirely of LOCC implementable maps. Finally, we demonstrate a two-qubit map whose action can be approached arbitrarily close using LOCC, but nevertheless cannot be implemented perfectly.},

  abstract = {All our former experience with application of quantum theory seems to say: \{\textbackslash it what is predicted by quantum formalism must occur in laboratory\}. But the essence of quantum formalism - entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen and Schr\textbackslash "odinger - waited over 70 years to enter to laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, is a potential for many quantum processes, including ``canonical'' ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation and dense coding. However, it appeared that this new resource is very complex and difficult to detect. Being usually fragile to environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation and quantifying. In particular, the authors discuss various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, quantum cryptography and point out some interrelations. They also discuss a basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within distant labs paradigm and stress some peculiarities such as irreversibility of entanglement manipulations including its extremal form - bound entanglement phenomenon. A basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized.},

  abstract = {We explore the relationship between two popular concepts in the allocation of divisible items: competitive equilibrium (CE) and allocations with maximum Nash welfare, i.e., allocations where the weighted geometric mean of the utilities is maximal. When agents have homogeneous concave utility functions, these two concepts coincide: the classical Eisenberg-Gale convex program that maximizes Nash welfare over feasible allocations yields a competitive equilibrium. However, these two concepts diverge for non-homogeneous utilities. From a computational perspective, maximizing Nash welfare amounts to solving a convex program for any concave utility functions, computing CE becomes PPAD-hard already for separable piecewise linear concave (SPLC) utilities. We introduce the concept of Gale-substitute utility functions, which is an analogue of the weak gross substitutes (WGS) property for the so-called Gale demand system. For Gale-substitutes utilities, we show that any allocation maximizing Nash welfare provides an approximate-CE with surprisingly strong guarantees, where every agent gets at least half the maximum utility they can get at any CE, and is approximately envy-free. Gale-substitutes include utility functions where computing CE is PPAD hard, such as all separable concave utilities and the previously studied non-separable class of Leontief-free utilities. We introduce a broad new class of utility functions called generalized network utilities based on the generalized flow model. This class includes SPLC and Leontief-free utilities, and we show that all such utilities are Gale-substitutes. Conversely, although some agents may get much higher utility at a Nash welfare maximizing allocation than at a CE, we show a price of anarchy type result: for general concave utilities, every CE achieves at least \$(1/e)\textasciicircum\{1/e\} {$>$} 0.69\$ fraction of the maximum Nash welfare, and this factor is tight.},

We provide a conclusive answer to this problem by appealing to the completeness property of the majorization lattice. We give a proof of this property that relies heavily on the more geometric construction provided by the Lorenz curves, which allows to explicitly obtain the corresponding infimum and supremum. Our framework includes the case of possibly non-denumerable sets of target states (i.e. targets sets described by continuous parameters). In addition, we show that a notion of approximate majorization, which has recently found application in quantum thermodynamics, is in close relation with the completeness of this lattice. Finally, we provide some examples of optimal common resources within the resource theory of quantum coherence.},

Additional flexibility in the data layer underlying all "quantum objects" in QuTiP allows us to harness the power of state-of-the-art data formats and packages like JAX, CuPy, and more.

In this paper, we first present an unified view of these proofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing argument applied to a covariancepreserving linear transformation; 2) an integration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these ingredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual information inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman‚Äôs Fisher information inequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai, and Verd√∫ used in earlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it relies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then generalized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder‚Äôs generalized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and Johnson‚Äôs EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath‚Äôs covariance-constrained EPI, and Costa‚Äôs concavity inequality for the entropy power.},

  abstract = {The linear-polarization correlation of pairs of photons emitted in a radiative cascade of calcium has been measured. The new experimental scheme, using two-channel polarizers (i.e., optical analogs of Stern-Gerlach filters), is a straightforward transposition of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm gedankenexperiment. The present results, in excellent agreement with the quantum mechanical predictions, lead to the greatest violation of generalized Bell's inequalities ever achieved.},

  abstract = {We present an object-oriented open-source framework for solving the dynamics of open quantum systems written in Python. Arbitrary Hamiltonians, including time-dependent systems, may be built up from operators and states defined by a quantum object class, and then passed on to a choice of master equation or Monte-Carlo solvers. We give an overview of the basic structure for the framework before detailing the numerical simulation of open system dynamics. Several examples are given to illustrate the build up to a complete calculation. Finally, we measure the performance of our library against that of current implementations. The framework described here is particularly well-suited to the fields of quantum optics, superconducting circuit devices, nanomechanics, and trapped ions, while also being ideal for use in classroom instruction.},
