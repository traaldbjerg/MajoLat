A mathematical characterization of these monotone magnitudes is presented. They are then related to optimal strategies of conversion of shared states. More detailed results are presented for pure states of bipartite systems. It is shown that more than one measure is required simultaneously in order to quantify completely the non-local resources contained in a bipartite pure state, while examining how this fact does not hold in the so-called asymptotic limit. Finally, monotonicity under local transformations is proposed as the only natural requirement for measures of entanglement.},

The so-called thermodynamic arrow of time introduces an ordering that divides the system's state space into past, future, and incomparable regions. In this work, we analyze the structure of the resulting thermal cones, i.e., sets of states that a given state can thermodynamically evolve to (the future thermal cone) or evolve from (the past thermal cone). Specifically, for a ùëë-dimensional classical state of a system interacting with a heat bath, we find explicit construction of the past thermal cone and the incomparable region. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of their behavior based on thermodynamic monotones given by the volumes of thermal cones. Results obtained apply also to other majorization-based resource theories (such as that of entanglement and coherence), since the partial ordering describing allowed state transformations is then the opposite of the thermodynamic order in the infinite temperature limit. Finally, we also generalize the construction of thermal cones to account for probabilistic transformations.},

For K = N the induced measure is equal to the Hilbert-Schmidt measure, which is shown to coincide with the measure induced by singular values of non-Hermitian random Gaussian matrices pertaining to the Ginibre ensemble. We compute several averages with respect to this measure and show that the mean entanglement of N√óN pure states behaves as lnN-1/2.},

We note that in the infinite-temperature limit, the thermodynamic ordering of states in both regimes exhibits a lattice structure. This means that when energy does not matter and the only thermodynamic resource is given by information, the thermodynamic arrow of time has a very specific structure. Namely, for any two states at present there exists a unique state in the past consistent with them and with all possible joint pasts. Similarly, there also exists a unique state in the future consistent with those states and with all possible joint futures. We also show that the lattice structure in the classical regime is broken at finite temperatures, i.e., when energy is a relevant thermodynamic resource. Surprisingly, however, we prove that in the simplest quantum scenario of a two-dimensional system, this structure is preserved at finite temperatures. We provide the physical interpretation of these results by introducing and analyzing the history erasure process, and point out that quantum coherence may be a necessary resource for the existence of an optimal erasure process.},
