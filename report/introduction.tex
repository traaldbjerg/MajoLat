Entanglement has long been one of the most puzzling features of quantum mechanics. It was first described in 1935 by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, who noticed that the Hilbert space nature of quantum states allowed some particles to be in some special superpositions that would connect two particles even at a distance, and that measuring one of the particles could determine the state of the other particle. They conjectured in their seminal paper that the properties of such states were so absurd that their theoretical existence had to imply that quantum mechanics had to be an incomplete theory \cite{einstein_can_1935}. Investigating the question, Bell published in 1964 a set of correlation inequalities that any local, hidden-variable model had to satisfy, and then showed that entangled states were capable of violating them CITATION NEEDED. The philosophical ramifications of such a result, which implies that quantum mechanics (and thus our world) must be inherently non-local if the existence of entangled states was ever demonstrated experimentally, are profound.

The experimental confirmation of entanglement only came much later, when experiments showed that photon pairs could indeed violate Bell's inequalities, showing stronger correlations than classically possible CITATION NEEDED. This verification prompted new enthusiasm for the theory of entanglement and its ramifications in many fields, looking for deeper insight into the nature of the universe and advanced technological applications. One such field is quantum information, where entanglement has been the source of powerful applications such as quantum cryptography, quantum key distribution, distributed quantum computing, \dots CITATION NEEDED

In 1999, Nielsen proved the conditions under which an entangled pure state shared between two quantum computers can be deterministically transformed into another if the computers can only communicate through a classical channel, a practical paradigm known as Local Operations and Classical Communications (LOCC) \cite{nielsen_conditions_1999}. This result showed that manipulating entangled states is theoretically feasible, and a few months later Vidal proved a generalization of his theorem, giving the maximal success probability of non-deterministic entanglement transformations \cite{vidal_entanglement_1999}. 

Interestingly, both of these impactful theorems are written in the language of majorization theory, which is a mathematical field that studies how to compare probability distributions based on how certain they are \cite{marshall_inequalities_2011}. Such concepts can be connected to information theory, thanks to a property of Shannon entropy called Schur-concavity, which is not surprising as it also attempts to capture how uncertain a random variable is. The majorization relation is not a total order, and so probability distributions do not have a \textit{more/less ordered than} relationship with every other probability distribution: we say that the majorization relation induces a \textit{preorder} on probability distributions. Such preorders sometimes admit an infimum (the meet) and supremum (the join), generating mathematical structures called lattices, which are well-studied in order theory \cite{davey_introduction_2002}. In 2002, Cicalese and Vaccaro showed that the majorization relation does admit such an infimum and supremum and introduced the majorization lattice, and showed some new properties of Shannon entropy on these meet and join distributions known as \textit{supermodularity} and \textit{subadditivity} \cite{cicalese_supermodularity_2002}. In 2013, along with Gargano, they also used the majorization lattice to define an entropic distance for probability distributions \cite{cicalese_information_2013}.

The majorization lattice is a more sophisticated tool to study majorization relations and entropic inequalities. Taking inspiration from economics, recent years have seen the development of Quantum Resource Theories (QRT) such as the theories of quantum entanglement, quantum thermodynamics, quantum coherence, and many others \cite{chitambar_quantum_2019}. Several of those are majorization-based, and the majorization lattice was used to define special states, called the Optimal Common Resource (OCR) of a set of targets which is the state with the least amount of (entanglement) resource capable of reaching (by LOCC) all of the targets of the set, ensuring minimal waste of resource \cite{bosyk_optimal_2019}. The optimality of LOCC protocols constructing such OCR entangled states has also been studied and proven using the majorization lattice \cite{deside_probabilistic_2024}.

In this master thesis, we study applications of the majorization lattice in the theory of entanglement. The first section provides an overview of the litterature. First, in chapter \ref{chap:majorization}, a theoretical explanation of majorization theory and the majorization lattice is given. Then, chapter \ref{chap:quantum_information} provides a review of quantum information, going from classical information and Shannon entropy to Nielsen and Vidal's LOCC reachability theorems, which are the main connection point with majorization theory.

The second part of this manuscript goes over new results found during this master thesis. Chapter \ref{chap:alternative} goes over new, more general proofs of supermodularity and subadditivity for a broader class of functions than only Shannon entropy, which were achieved by using a novel concatenation-based technique to find an underlying majorization relation (which we call a \textit{majorization precursor}). Then, chapter \ref{chap:criteria} quickly goes over an improvement to coupled entropic criteria based on the meet of two distributions which might be of interest in some experimental setups. Next, chapter \ref{chap:incomparability} goes over definitions of new entropic quantities which we incomparability monotones, quantifying how incomparable two probability distributions are by taking inspiration from QRTs, along with theorems showing their behavior under LOCC. Finally, chapter \ref{chap:volume} generalizes those incomparability monotones to sets of states, by exploiting the inclusion-exclusion principle and a relation between the intersection of majorization cones and the cone of their join. With this new entropic inclusion-exclusion formula, we prove several properties which seem to indicate that Shannon entropy behaves like the volume of majorization cones, and use this idea to quantify the redundancy of a state relative to a bank of entangled states. Using these redundancy measures, LOCC state selection strategies were proposed which, according to our numerical simulations, run out of entangled states capable of reaching successive LOCC targets slower ???? \textit{on average} than naive strategies based only on the entropy of individual states.
